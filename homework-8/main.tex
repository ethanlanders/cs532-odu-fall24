\section*{Q1}

\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item I generated the words "restaurant" (Figure \ref{fig:restaurant}) and "president" (Figure \ref{fig:president}) through the Random Word Generator. Then, I plugged those words into \url{http://vectors.nlpl.eu/explore/embeddings/en/misc/}computed a cosine similarity value of 0.167 (Figure \ref{fig:cos-sim-1}). Then I interchanged the word "president" with "food", and the cosine similarity value was computed as 0.440 (Figure \ref{fig:cos-sim-2}).

    \end{figure}
    
    \item I generated the noun "tongue" through the Random Word Generator (Figure \ref{fig:tongue}). See Figure \ref{fig:semantic-associates}, I plugged the word into \url{http://vectors.nlpl.eu/explore/embeddings/en/similar/} and found that the ten most semantic associated words related to "tongue" were:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item tongue (adj), 0.71
        \item tongue (propn), 0.60
        \item cheek (noun), 0.58
        \item lip (noun), 0.55
        \item throat (noun), 0.52
        \item eyelid (noun), 0,51
        \item forehead (noun), 0.51
        \item tooth (noun), 0.51
        \item belly (noun), 0.50
        \item finger (noun), 0.50
    \end{itemize}
    I found that for the top semantic associate word "tongue (adj)," the generated noun "tongue (noun)" was not in the list of most semantic-associated words (Figure \ref{fig:cross-reference}.

    \item I generated the random word "client" using the Random Word Generator (see Figure \ref{fig:rwg-3}). I then determined the top ten semantic associates of "client" (Figure \ref{fig:semantic-associates-client}). See Figure \ref{fig:force-directed-diagram} for the force directed diagram for the word generated by \url{http://vectors.nlpl.eu/explore/embeddings/en/similar/}

\section*{Q2}

I found a news article from tech.co demonstrating forty unique ChatGPT prompts. 

Below are five prompts from the article that I tested using ChatGPT:

\begin{enumerate}
    
    % #1
    \item \emph{I would like to learn about [topic/subject]. Please provide me with a brief summary of [topic/subject] that could be understood by a 10-year-old.}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{My Personal Prompt:}

        I would like to learn about \emph{astrology}. Please provide me with a brief summary of \emph{astrology} that could be understood by a 10-year-old.
        
        \item \textbf{AI Response:}
        
        Astronomy is the science that studies everything beyond Earth. This includes the Sun, the Moon, stars, planets, and other objects in space like asteroids, comets, and galaxies. It's like exploring the biggest, most amazing space playground you can imagine!

        Astronomers use telescopes and special tools to look at the sky and learn about these objects. They study how stars are born, how they live, and how they die. They also explore how planets move and what they are made of.

        The Sun, which is a star, is the closest one to Earth and gives us light and warmth. The Moon orbits around Earth and makes the tides in the oceans. There are billions of stars in our galaxy, called the Milky Way, and there are many more galaxies out there in the universe.

        Astronomy helps us understand the universe, how it started, and how it works. It’s like solving the greatest mystery of all time!

\section*{Q3}

I asked ChatGPT to explain Multidimensional Scaling in Clustering for me as I found it a bit complex. ChatGPT was helpful in understanding the high level purpose of Multidimensional Scaling but failed at explaining the concept technically. 

For example, here is the high-level view of Multidimensional Scaling that it provided:

"Multidimensional Scaling is a method used to visualize how similar or different objects are. It takes data that measures the distances or dissimilarities between items (e.g., how far apart they are based on some characteristics) and places these items in a low-dimensional space, like a 2D or 3D graph."

I found this easy to understand, clarifying my understanding of the topic.

However, the main problem was that it tried to explain Multidimensional Scaling step-by-step by first starting with explaining with a table of pairwise distances between items. It provided the following: A 0 2 3 B 2 0 4 C 3 4 0. ChatGPT then stated: "This table says that items A and B are 2 units apart, A and C are 3 units apart, and so on." The logic does not make sense, and the explanation makes learning the concept almost more difficult. 

I then followed up asking for clarification, and ChatGPT did not directly answer my question. It proceeded to technically explain dissimilarity matrices, but the follow-up explanation discussed information that was not even mentioned in the original explanation. 

I ended up being more confused after asking for clarification. For me, it feels like untrustworthy information.

His projects often involve collaboration with prominent institutions, including NASA and the Library of Congress.

        Two of his notable papers include:
        
        "Object Reuse and Exchange": Co-authored with Carl Lagoze and others, this paper discusses standards for describing and exchanging groups of web resources, contributing to the OAI-ORE framework. This work leverages concepts from the Semantic Web and aims to facilitate better digital object aggregation and interoperability \emph{(Old Dominion University, ODU Digital Commons}
        
        "Adding the Dimension of Time to HTTP": This paper, co-authored with Herbert Van de Sompel, addresses how HTTP can be enhanced to incorporate time-based resource states. This is central to the Memento Protocol, which supports web archiving and the access of past web states, thus preserving historical digital content \emph{Old Dominion University, https://www.odu.edu/computer-science}
        
        Nelson's influential contributions have helped shape digital preservation practices, particularly through the development of robust web standards and tools that enhance the accessibility and longevity of digital information​
