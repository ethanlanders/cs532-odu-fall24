The rule that a visa issued by the embassy or consulate is required before entering Germany for a long-term stay does not exceptionally apply to war refugees from Ukraine. This exception applies to first-time entries until 31th December 2024 for a period of 90 days. Entry (germany4ukraine.de)
Ukrainian nationals who are already resident in Germany with a residence permit can apply for a residence permit in accordance with Section 24 AufenthG. This applies to cases in which – it is not possible to extend the existing residence permit due to legal requirements or because the conditions for issuing the permit no longer apply, or – during the period of validity of the residence permit, the reason for issuing it or a condition for issuing it, e.g. securing a living for students, no longer applies and its subsequent limitation should be considered.
When you entered Germany, whether before or after 24.2.2022, is irrelevant. More
Contacting the Foreigners’ Registration Office / Receiving benefits
You can register in all German cities. In order to do so, it is best to go to the Ausländerbehörde (Foreigners’ Registration Office), but you can also go to the police or the Federal Police (Bundespolizei). First aiders standing at railway stations and airports can also guide you.
As of 1st June, refugees from Ukraine in Germany covered by the scope of application of section 24 of Germany’s Residence Act (AufenthG) are able to receive basic social security benefits according to the German Social Code, Book II (SGB II). To receive these benefits, you need to register as mentioned above. Once you are registered, you will receive an “arrival certificate”. With this, you can go to the social welfare office in your city, where you will receive the benefits, you are entitled to. These are benefits in cash and in kind. After registration, you can also, for example, work in Germany or go to the doctor.
Important! After regular enrolment in a degree-oriented programme, you can no longer receive social benefits, but you can receive the Federal Training Assistance (BAföG). Guest student or exchange students, on the other hand, receive social benefits and may not apply for BAföG.
Longer-term residence title
In order to stay in Germany for a longer period of time, it is necessary to obtain a residence title. A “residence title” (Aufenthaltstitel) determines the residence of foreigners in Germany. The application for a longer residence title is made at the responsible Foreigners’ Registration Office (Ausländerbehörde) at your place of residence.
Please note that refugees from Ukraine have various options when applying for a residence title. These differ in, among other things, which country of origin you come from, in which activities you can pursue with these residence titles and which social benefits you can claim, if any.
