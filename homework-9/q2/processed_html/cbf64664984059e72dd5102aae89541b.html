UN official highlights growing toll of Ukraine war, rising threat of ‘nuclear incident’
28 August 2024
Peace and Security
Thirty months into Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, human suffering continues to worsen amid alarming reports of attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, including nuclear facilities, a senior UN political affairs official told the Security Council on Wednesday.
Miroslav Jenča, Assistant Secretary-General at the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that last month was particularly deadly for Ukrainian civilians, with at least 219 killed and more than 1,000 injured.
Since 24 February 2022 – the date of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the UN human rights office, OHCHR , has documented 11,662 civilian killings and 24,207 injuries. The actual figure could be higher.
“Tragically, these figures only grow, as missiles, shells and drones continue to hit cities, towns and villages across Ukraine daily,” Mr. Jenča said.
Fighting on Russian soil
He also voiced concern over the impact of the spread of fighting on civilians in the Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk regions of Russia.
Since the start of Ukraine’s incursion into the Kursk region on 6 August, at least 12 people have been killed and 121 others injured, according to local Russian officials. Over 130,000 people have been reportedly evacuated from the region.
Mr. Jenča reiterated the UN Secretary-General’s condemnation of attacks on civilians and infrastructure, wherever they occur.
“These attacks are prohibited by international humanitarian law. They must end immediately. We urge all sides to act responsibly and ensure the protection of civilians.”
Concerns over nuclear safety
The senior UN official further expressed alarm regarding reported incidents around nuclear facilities in Ukraine and Russia, in particular the deterioration of the nuclear safety situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
On 17 August, a drone strike hit the road around the power plant’s site perimeter. This incident followed a significant fire at one of the cooling towers on 11 August, which resulted in considerable damage.
Mr. Jenča added that concerns are also rising over nuclear safety and security in Russia’s Kursk region.
On 22 August, Russia reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) that remains of a drone were found within the territory of the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant.
“We continue to call for maximum restraint and vigilance to avoid a nuclear incident, the consequences of which could be catastrophic to the region and the world,” he urged.
Humanitarian situation
Mr. Jenča also highlighted the severe impact of the humanitarian crisis, particularly on women, who comprise 56 percent of the 15 million people in need of assistance in Ukraine.
“In frontline areas, particularly in the east and south of Ukraine, entire villages and towns have been either partially or completely devastated,” he said, adding, “humanitarian operations in some areas lack access to people in need.”
This year the UN and humanitarian partners aim to reach 8.5 million people with lifesaving assistance, including through the winter .
However, the response remains constrained, with only 41 percent of the $3.1 billion needed under the Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan received so far.
