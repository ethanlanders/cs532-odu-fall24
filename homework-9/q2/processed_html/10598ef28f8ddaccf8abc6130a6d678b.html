Dane Winkler: The Hum
Gordon Art Galleries On view Aug. 30 - Nov. 9, 2024
The Hum is an exhibition of sculpture that explores passing time and transformation through reconstruction. The materials and themes for this body of work were sourced from the farmland in upstate New York where I was raised. The gathering and alteration of these materials, both natural and person made - embodies a curiosity about place - looking into the past as well as the future, and my relationship with these sentiments.
In this context the title does not refer to a vocal hum but instead mysterious reports throughout history of a low frequency sound felt in specific locations across the globe. The Hum is a persistent tone only heard by some people in the regions it has been cited. Although the cause of this phenomenon has never been attributed to one thing, researchers have noted mechanical devices, tinnitus, or wildlife as a potential culprit. The title also attempts to speak to a personal observation of nowness. This place has always been an inspiring source throughout my career. Currently, the ethos of the property is changing, which carries with it immense privilege, responsibility, and complexity. Through observing and examining the land and its structure(s) with a new perspective looking forward… a connection is made between its substance and a notion of self. This exhibition asks if the objects of a place become embedded within its history. How can sculpture be used to re-form the physical reality of objects, altering their identity to conjure a new relationship to space? The items utilized are markers of time in relation to my home in distinct ways. This relates conceptually to a few possible explanations of The Hum mentioned above - tones from military low frequency radio waves, or the illuminating mating call of the Plainfin Midshipman fish. The Hum is the sound or essence of this embedded history.
Through these experiments utilizing design and architectural folly, the vibration is shaped into a new tone or form. The exploration of personal history in context with the mystery of these events extends to the viewer in this way…. challenging how our bodies and thoughts navigate through space.
The Hum is a sound, a feeling, and a question all at once. This body of work reflects on internal and external ideas about how family, agency, and wonder unite with these concepts.

Paintings from the Porch: Works by Jake McCord On view Jan. 12 - May 4, 2024 Opening Reception: Jan. 11 at 6 p.m.
Jake McCord (1945 - 2009) of Thomson, Georgia grew up planting and picking crops on his family's farm. He later cut grass and drove a truck for that city, which recognized him as an exceptionally hard worker. In the mid-1980s McCord began to paint and took inspiration from his life and several television sets running simultaneously in his home. He installed paintings on his front porch for passersby to see and would allow them to be sold only after feeling they had been on view for the right amount of time. McCord described his depictions of people, animals, and scenes as jolly, which helped keep him company and which he hoped would help those who saw his work. This exhibition presents a number of those jolly paintings from the porch.

Sam Bartlett: Low Stakes, Plywood Cutouts & Everyday Comix
Opening Reception: Feb. 2, 6 - 8 p.m.
Sam Bartlett is an American folk artist, public-art instigator, cartoonist, performer, musician, and composer.
As an artist, Sam specializes in painting and cutting sculptures from salvaged wood. He derives inspiration from the naturally low stakes involved in using free materials.
Sam does virtually no planning or sketching for his artwork, preferring to try to harness the energy of a first take. Common themes in his work include complex physical relationships between people, things on top of other things, things being bitten and eaten, old-time and Irish music communities, and mortality. He has been strongly influenced by artists Peter Schumann, Howard Finster, and Gustav Vigeland.

Concrete Ocean: Works by Leigh Merrill On view Jan.12 through Feb 17, 2024 Opening Reception: Thursday, Jan. 11 at 6 p.m.
“Culling through thousands of individual photographs and videos I make of architecture and landscaping; I digitally assemble these sources to create my work. Some images have veracity, but more often, they suggest a visual hyperbole – an embellished scene circulating around a small object or detail. I am continually fascinated with photography’s ability to be evidence of existence – creating an image with seeming veracity – and simultaneously, a system to mediate and construct reality. I use photography to observe and then digitally combine my photographs to construct spaces that do not exist, allowing the creation of images that, through metaphor and illusion, reveal both the desire and simulacrum present around us and within photography itself.”
