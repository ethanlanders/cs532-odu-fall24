Undergraduate Research Honors Scholar Program (URHS)
Registering for the URHS is the first step to receiving information about undergraduate research funding, research opportunities, and other research-related resources. Registered students can also apply for essential supply and equipment grants to offset the costs of their URHS activities.
Program Highlights
Program for Undergraduate Research and Scholarship (PURS)
The Old Dominion University Office of Undergraduate Research, part of the Division of Research and Economic Development, offers grants to support one-year pilot projects in research and other creative work activities. These projects are designed to provide undergraduate students with authentic research and creative activity experiences as a primary objective. Eligible applicants include research faculty, tenured faculty, and tenure-track faculty.
For the next 2025-2026 academic year, this program will evolve into a more robust initiative aligned with the new offerings planned by the Office of Undergraduate Research. Stay tuned for updates on these initiatives and the upcoming launch of the new “PURS” program.
Questions should be directed to Orlando Ayala, PhD ( oayala@odu.edu) .
The deadline for PURS is January 31, 2025.
