Graduate Program Directors
The Office of Advising Administration guides undergraduate students through academic challenges and choices, oversees the administration of professional advising for ODUâ€™s main campus, and partners with students to support them in achieving their educational goals.
Our office is located in the Student Success Center. You may contact the office at (757) 683-3699 or advisor@odu.edu .
We encourage all degree-seeking students to be advised prior to registering each semester to ensure they are taking classes that align with their academic plan and plans for graduation. If you have an advisor degree-plan hold preventing you from registering for classes, you must meet with your academic adviser who can remove the hold.
