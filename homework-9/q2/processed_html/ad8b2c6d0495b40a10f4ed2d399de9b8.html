German is one of the ten most spoken languages in the world. Some 185 million people worldwide speak German. You can still study in Germany even if you don’t know German, but some knowledge of the language makes everyday life a lot easier and help you immerse yourself in the country. Apart from that, foreign languages are also increasingly sought after by employers. There are many ways to learn German prior to your stay or while out there.  Whether you learn the traditional way by joining a class, or whether you team up with a German language tandem partner or flatmate, learning German can be great fun and hugely beneficial.
