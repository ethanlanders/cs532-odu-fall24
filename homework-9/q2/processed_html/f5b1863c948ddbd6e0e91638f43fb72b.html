Locate your University Identification Number
Your UIN (Student ID) is located on your offer of admission. This important ID number will enable various ODU departments (ex. Office of Student Financial Aid) to serve you more efficiently in the event you have any questions or concerns about  your student record.
Create Your MIDAS Account
MIDAS (Monarch Identification and Authorization System) is ODU's log-in and password management system. Use your MIDAS ID and password to log into most University applications and services, such as email, Canvas, myODU, Leo Online, Banner and many other important resources.
Visit midas.odu.edu and click Need an Account
Enter your University Identification Number (UIN), located on your decision letter. Follow the rest of the prompts and click Submit
Complete the remaining account creation steps. Once your MIDAS has been created, it is extremely important to write it down and keep it in a safe place. You'll need it for almost everything in the confirmation process and as a student.
