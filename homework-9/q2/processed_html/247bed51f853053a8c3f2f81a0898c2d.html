RSS Feeds
What is RSS?
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML-based format for distributing and aggregating Web content (such as news headlines).
Using RSS, web content providers can easily create and disseminate feeds of data that include, for example, news links, headlines, and summaries.
The UN NewsÂ provides a feed for top headlines, as well as feeds for news organized by topic, region and audio feeds.
