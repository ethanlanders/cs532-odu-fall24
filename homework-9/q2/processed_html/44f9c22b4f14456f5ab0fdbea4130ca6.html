Recognition of Study Achievements

In order to be able to study at a German university, you must clarify in advance whether you meet the requirements for university admission.
Successful completion of study periods in Ukraine may be recognised as a prerequisite for university admission, but the resulting university admission may, for example, only be subject-specific. In addition, it is possible that previous study achievements do not grant you admission to higher education.
Many German universities currently offer uncomplicated solutions to enable Ukrainian students to participate in study programmes as guest students. This enables you to actively participate in university life, acquire knowledge and make contact with other students during your time in Germany. Please note that participation as a guest student does not lead to an academic degree and is not offered by every university. To clarify these and further questions, please contact the respective university directly for binding information.
The higher education institution at which you wish to study is responsible for admissions issues. The following information will provide you with an overview.
Contact points for the recognition of academic achievements gained abroad
Ukraine has been a member of the Bologna Process since 2005. If you would like to continue your studies in Germany, your previous academic achievements may be recognised in Germany. However, this does not necessarily mean that academic achievements gained in Ukraine automatically entitle you to apply for a university place .
The DAAD offers a first point of contact in the form of the admissions database on its website. This provides non-binding information on the extent to which you can be admitted to a degree programme at a German higher education institution on the basis of a school leaving certificate or periods of study completed in Ukraine.
The final decision on the recognition of academic achievements gained abroad is made by the university at which you wish to study. You can find the contact details of the International Offices on the DAAD website.
