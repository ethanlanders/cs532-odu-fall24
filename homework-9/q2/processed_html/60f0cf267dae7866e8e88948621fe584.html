Student Testimonials
Brad Lee ' 21
I'm a nontraditional low-income student with physical disabilities, and ODU's social mobility mission has played a key role in helping me overcome educational disadvantages. As a first-generation college student, I want to give my son the legacy of education. ODU has been a catalyst in allowing me to achieve my goals.
