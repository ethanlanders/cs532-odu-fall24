On these pages you will find a selection of research news from the Leibniz Institutes.
How fake news is slowing down the energy transition
11/01/2024 · Leibniz Institute for Psychology
Misinformation about wind farms is widely accepted. This is more due to worldviews than a lack of knowledge, a study reveals.
Three pathways to achieve global climate goals
11/01/2024 · Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research
Contrary to the belief that the path to sustainable development is increasingly out of reach, results show that humankind has a variety of pathways to depart from its current unsustainable trajectory.
Educational initiative for the chip industry
11/01/2024 · Ferdinand-Braun-Institut, Leibniz-Institut für Höchstfrequenztechnik
The new “Microtec Academy” meets the growing demand for skilled workers with innovative training programs.
Arms race between plant and fungus

New results impressively show how a fungal pathogen not only bypasses the plant's immune system, but even successfully exploits it to its own advantage.
Birth: It’s a tight squeeze for chimpanzees, too
10/31/2024 · Senckenberg society for nature research
The “obstetrical dilemma” evolved gradually over the course of primate evolution rather than suddenly in humans as originally argued.
Old oil, new products

A new catalyst uses cooking oil to synthesize primary amines – important precursors for a variety of products in daily live.
Echoes of communism
10/02/2024 · Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies
Germans who lived in the former German Democratic Republic value free speech less than West Germans, a new study finds.
New milestone in plant magnetic resonance imaging
09/27/2024 · Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research
Magnetic resonance imaging is primarily known from medical diagnostics. However, it also facilitates research into plant metabolism.
Fundamental knowledge for sustainable energy
09/20/2024 · Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology
Researchers unveil new ways to control light absorption with iron compounds. The new findings open up exciting possibilities for sustainable technologies.
Mitochondria on the move
09/17/2024 · Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy
An international team of researchers has developed an innovative mitochondrial transfer platform to supercharge T cells, enabling them to overcome exhaustion and more effectively fight tumor cells.
Millions in funding for HIV research
07/31/2024 · Leibniz Institute of Virology
Ulrike Lange, researcher at the Leibniz Institute of Virology, and her international team have been awarded a grant of 2.79 million US dollars to develop new therapeutic strategies against HIV.
'Jumping Genes' support immune cells
07/26/2024 · Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy
Jumping genes make up almost half of human DNA. For a long time, they were thought to serve no purpose. But new studies show that they play a crucial role in gene regulation.
Paradoxical bitter taste?
07/23/2024 · Leibniz Institute for Food Systems Biology at the Technical University of Munich
A bitter taste often warns us of potentially harmful substances. However, not everything that tastes bitter is harmful. But why is that?
Genome of golden algae decoded
07/22/2024 · Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries
The Oder disaster in 2022 was man-made, but the direct cause was the toxin produced by a microalgae. Researchers have now been able to identify the genes responsible for the toxin formation.
Cultivating mangroves is good for the planet
07/19/2024 · Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research
Planted mangroves can achieve three quarters of the carbon content of natural forests within 20 to 40 years and thus make an important contribution to climate protection.
EarthCARE ready for launch
05/28/2024 · Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research
The satellite will measure clouds, aerosols and radiation in the atmosphere more precisely than ever before. This is also made possible by state-of-the-art processors.
Innovative deep-sea analysis protects the environment
05/22/2024 · Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology
The seafloor contains large deposits of valuable minerals and metals. A new method helps analysing them in an environmentally friendly way.
New target for breast cancer drugs
05/21/2024 · Leibniz Institute on Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute
The transcription factor TRPS1 could serve as a new target for drugs against breast cancer, a study reveals.
The power of ambiguity
05/16/2024 · Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research
A new mathematical model simulates how people change opinions on climate issues and suggest that more ambiguity in communication may foster consensus.
10 years of Leibniz Mentoring
04/15/2024 · Leibniz Association
Leibniz Mentoring is celebrating its tenth birthday! To mark the occasion, we are holding a party and taking a look back.
