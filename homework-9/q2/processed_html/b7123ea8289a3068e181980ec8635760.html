Humanitarian aid to civilians in eastern Ukraine “has to trump everything” said the UN humanitarian chief after visiting the area.
Stephen O’Brien, UN Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, said he had had helpful discussions with Russian officials to prioritize aid.
The UN estimates that 1.5 million people have been displaced, with almost 8,000 killed, since hostilities began last year.
Ukrainian government forces have been fighting separatist rebels in the east of the country.
