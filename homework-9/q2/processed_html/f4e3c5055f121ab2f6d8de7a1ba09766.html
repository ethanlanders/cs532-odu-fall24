Diplomatic efforts are continuing at the United Nations to ease tensions in the Ukrainian region of Crimea.
Members of the Security Council are considering tabling a resolution on the upcoming referendum in Crimea, a referendum which could lead to the secession of Crimea from Ukraine to Russia.
The resolution would urge respect for Ukraine's sovereignty, while reiterating that the referendum violates the Ukrainian constitution.
Itâ€™s likely that if a resolution is tabled, that Russia would reject it.
