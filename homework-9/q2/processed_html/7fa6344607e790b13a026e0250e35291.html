3. Type, scope, purposes and legal basis for data processing
Below you will find an overview of the type, scope, purposes and legal basis of data processing on our website.
3.1 Provision of our website
When you access our website on your device, we process the following data:
Date and time of access
Duration of visit
IP address
Domain name
We process this data on the basis of GDPR Article 6 (1) point f, as they are required for us to provide the service, to ensure technical operation and to investigate and remove malfunctions. It is in our interest to ensure the use and technical operability of our website. This data is automatically processed when our website is accessed. Unless they are provided, you cannot use our services. We usually erase these data after seven days unless, under exceptional circumstances, we need them for a longer period for the above-mentioned purposes. In such a case we erase the data as soon as they are no longer required for the relevant purpose.
3.2 Contact form
You have the option of contacting us through a form.
If you use the “Contact form”, we need the following mandatory details (marked as such): First Name, Surname, Country of residence, Country of origin (citizenship), Email address, Current level of education, on which topics would you like to be informed, in which subject area are you interested. However, you can voluntarily provide additional details, such as gender.
The data serves the purpose of meeting your request for contact. We process this data on the basis of GDPR Article 6 (1) point f. The purpose of processing your data is solely to deal with your contact request. As soon as your contact request has been concluded, we will erase the data we have collected via the contact form. Any personal data that were additionally collected during the sending process are erased if they are no longer required for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
3.3 Social plug-ins
This website uses social plug-ins from the social media Facebook, Google+ and Twitter operated by Meta Platforms Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA, Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA and Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA, respectively. You will find three buttons on our website, enabling you to share content on Facebook, Google+ and Twitter, so that you can conveniently recommend our website to friends on your preferred social media platforms. A so-called Shariff solution has been implemented on our website. When you call up our website, data is not automatically sent to the relevant social media.
But when you click on a social media button, your browser uses this social plug-in to set up a direct connection to the server of the relevant social network. The legal basis for the transfer of data to the previously mentioned social networks is your consent (pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 letter a, 49 Para. 1 letter a DSGVO). In this respect, your personal data will be transferred to bodies in a third country (outside the European Economic Area), although a level of data protection comparable to that under EU law is not guaranteed. Therefore, compliance with the data protection principles of EU law is not guaranteed. We have no influence on the scope of the data which is collected by the social media operators in this way. The operators process the information that you have called up our website. If you are also logged into one of the social media platforms at that time, the operator can match up your account with the relevant social media site. If you then also interact with the social plug-in by clicking “Like” or “Share”, the relevant social media site will process that information. Even if you are not a member of one of these social media platforms, it is possible for them to find out your IP address through the social plug-in and then possibly store this information. Further information about the scope and purpose for which data is processed, collected and used by Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as your rights in this respect and the setting options, can be found in each company’s data protection policy:
If you do not want social media to collect data via our website, make sure you do not click on the relevant buttons. In addition, you can block social plug-ins via add-ons in your browser.
3.4 Google Analytics
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (hereinafter: “Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies (see clause 5), i.e. text files which are saved to your computer and allow us to analyse your use of the website. The information that is created by cookies on your use of our website is usually sent to a Google server in the United States, where it is then stored. However, if you have activated IP anonymisation for this website, your IP address will not be sent without first being truncated by Google within the Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the United States and then truncated there. Acting on behalf of the site operators, Google will use this information to analyse your use of the website, to create reports on website activities for us as site operators and to provide us with other services connected with website and internet use. The IP address which Google Analytics sends via your browser will not be linked by Google with any other data Google may have.
This website uses Google Analytics with the extension “_anonymizeIp()”. This has the effect of truncating IP addresses before further processing, so that the data cannot be related to any specific person. If the data that is collected about you allows conclusions about you as a person, this is immediately prevented and the relevant personal data are thus erased immediately.
We use Google Analytics to analyse use of our website and to improve it at regular intervals. The statistical data we receive in this way helps us to improve our website and to make it more interesting for you as a user. In the exceptional cases in which personal data is transferred to Google (USA), your personal data is transferred to a third country (outside the European Economic Area). To ensure an adequate level of data protection, we have concluded so-called EU standard contractual clauses with Google. You can obtain from us a copy of the specifically agreed regulations to ensure an adequate level of data protection. Please use the information provided under point 1.
The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is GDPR Article 6 (1) point a, i.e. your consent. Any data that we send, and which is linked to cookies, user IDs or advertising IDs, is automatically erased after 14 months. Any data that has reached the end of its retention period is automatically erased once a month.
You can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting the cookie settings accordingly. However, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent.

OpenStreetMap is an open source mapping tool which is offered by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) based on the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL). To display the map, you must first click on “Show Map”. Only then your IP address will be forwarded to OpenStreetMap. Your data will be processed on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 letter a) DSGVO).

This function is primarily used to distinguish whether an input is made by a natural person or abusive by automated and automated processing. The service includes the sending of the IP address and possibly other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to Google and is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR based on our legitimate interest in determining the individual will-bearingness of actions on the Internet and the prevention of abuse and spam.

3.7 YouTube Videos
On our website video clips from the video portal YouTube are embedded. YouTube is a portal of YouTube, LLC, a subsidiary of Google Inc.
For reasons of data protection, we have decided not to integrate the video clips directly into our site, but to deactivate them by default. Therefore, when you call up our site, no data is transmitted to Google. Therefore you will find on our website only a preview image of the video clip. To play the video clip, you need to activate it by clicking on the preview image. By clicking, you give your consent to the transfer of data to YouTube. The legal basis for the processing of your data is therefore your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO. Only after this activation a connection to the servers of Google is established and data is transmitted to Google. In this respect, your personal data will be transferred to bodies in a third country (outside the European Economic Area), although a level of data protection comparable to that under EU law is not guaranteed. Therefore, compliance with the data protection principles of EU law is not guaranteed. We have no influence on the scope of the data collected in this respect.
For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection, the further processing and use of data by Google, your rights in this regard and setting options for protecting your privacy, please refer to Google’s privacy policy at: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ .

If websites and services by other site owners are linked to this website, they have been and will continue to be designed and supplied by third parties. We have no influence on the design, content or function of third-party services, and we expressly distance ourselves from any content provided by linked third-party sites. Please remember that third-party sites linked to this website may have their own cookies which are installed on your device to collect personal data. We have no influence over this.

We use so-called cookies to provide you with extensive functions, to make our website more user-friendly and to optimise our website. Cookies are small files which are saved to your device via your web browser.
If you click here, you can change the cookie settings: Change cookie settings
Categories of cookies
We use cookies for a variety of purposes and with different functions. Moreover, we make distinctions between cookies, depending on whether they are mandatory from a technical perspective (i.e. a technical requirement), how long they are stored and used (known as the retention period) and whether they have been set by our website itself or by a third party and, if so, by whom (i.e. by which cookie provider).
Technical requirement and legal basis
Technically mandatory cookies: We use certain cookies because they are mandatory requirements to ensure that our website and its functions can work in a legally compliant manner. Such cookies are automatically set when the website or a specific function is accessed, unless you have prevented the setting of cookies through your browser settings. Any data collected through the use of such cookies are processed by us on the basis of GDPR Article 6 (1) point f.
Technically non-mandatory cookies: On the other hand, non-mandatory cookies are set to improve, for instance, the convenience and performance of our website or to save certain settings you have made. We also use technically non-mandatory cookies to obtain information on the frequency with which certain parts of our website are used, so that we can tailor them more closely to your needs in the future. We do not store technically non-mandatory cookies until you click the relevant box, confirming that you have read our cookie note, and continue to use our website. Any data collected through the use of such cookies is processed by us on the basis of GDPR Article 6 (1) point a.
Retention period
Session cookies: Most cookies are only required for as long as you access the current service or continue your session. They are either erased or lose their validity as soon as you leave our website or your current session has expired (these are so-called session cookies). Session cookies are used, for instance, to retain certain information during your session.
Permanent cookies: It happens occasionally that cookies are saved for a longer period of time, for instance, to recognise you when you open our website again at a later point. It means that you can call up saved settings again. This means you can access our website faster and more conveniently, and you don’t have to make certain settings again, e.g. specify the relevant language. Permanent cookies are automatically deleted upon the expiry of a defined period of time following the date on which you visited the site or domain where the cookie was set.
Cookie providers
Third-party cookies: So-called third-party cookies are set and used by other providers or websites, for example by operators of web analysis tools. Further details on web analysis tools and range measurement can be found below in this Policy. Third-party providers can also use cookies to display adverts or to integrate social media content, e.g. social plug-ins.

If you do not want cookies to be saved to your device, you can disable the relevant option in the system settings of your browser. Saved cookies can be deleted through the system settings in your browser at any time. Please note, however, that if you do not accept cookies, the functions of our services may be limited.
