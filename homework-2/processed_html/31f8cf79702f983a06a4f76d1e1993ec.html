Academic Advising
Academic Advising
At ODU we use professional advisors and faculty advisors to support our diverse student population. Our university policy requires all degree seeking students to meet with their academic advisor to ensure academic success. You’ll meet with your advisor each semester to discuss academic and career goals, course scheduling, and academic success resources.
Advisors are available year-round to assist students. It’s best to reach out to your advisor early each semester. to ensure that you have a solid academic success plan and can register for the next semester. The AD – Degree Plan Hold prevents registration and is moved after you meet with your advisor. Holds do not become active until right before registration opens each semester, but even if you don’t see a hold on your record, you can still meet with your advisor!
With over 120 undergraduate programs, 130 graduate programs at the master's, education specialist and doctoral levels plus a wealth of certificate and professional development programs, Old Dominion University has the program for you.
