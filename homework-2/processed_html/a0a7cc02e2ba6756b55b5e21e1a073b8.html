UN Humanitarian Work
3 Strategic Objectives
The overall goal in DPRK is to support and reinforce national efforts to ensure people’s health and well-being, especially the most vulnerable, and to build their resilience. To achieve this, the DPRK Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) has agreed on the following strategic objectives in 2018:
Objective 1:  IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION
Improve the nutritional status of the most vulnerable people using an integrated and multi-sectoral approach that includes improved and stabilised food security and screening for acute malnutrition. Partners will work to ensure that the most vulnerable people, particularly pregnant and breastfeeding women and under-five children, have access to sufficient nutritious food, and that acutely undernourished children are effectively treated with therapeutic food and supported through optimal infant and young child feeding practices.
Objective 2:  ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES
Reduce preventable mortality and morbidity through increased access to health, water, sanitation and hygiene services. Partners will ensure that the most vulnerable people, including children, women, people with disabilities and the elderly, have access to basic health services including maternal, new-born and child health, immunizations and early interventions for people with disabilities. Access to basic services also includes access to improved water, sanitation and hygiene services.
Objective 3:  STRENGTHEN RESILIENCE TO RECURRENT DISASTERS
Build the resilience of the most vulnerable people in DPRK to recurrent disasters, particularly floods and drought. Partners will ensure that life-saving assistance meets the different needs of those most affected by disasters and that the DPRK Government and communities have the capacity to prepare for, respond to, and recover from shocks related to natural disasters.
