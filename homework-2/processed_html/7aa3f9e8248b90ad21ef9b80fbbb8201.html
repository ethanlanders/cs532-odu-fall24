Mahmoud Ahmad Al-Said remembers his birthplace and the ancestors who came before him. Seventy six years ago, the Palestinian refugee, who has devoted his life to teaching children, was forcibly displaced from his home village of Al-Birwa approximately 9 km northeast of Acre. It is well-known as the birthplace of the renowned poet Mahmoud Darwish. While the village and surrounding area still hold many memories for the 84-year-old, the community has since been completely destroyed and replaced by what is now known as moshav Ahihud in Israel and kibbutz Yas’ur.
