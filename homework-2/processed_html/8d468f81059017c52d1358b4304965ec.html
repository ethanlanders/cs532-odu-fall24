In this week’s show, we’re in touch with a very busy COVID-19 call centre in the Central African Republic; we’ll also hear from the Human Rights Council where Ukraine’s unresolved crisis has been in the spotlight. An alarming heat record has been declared in the Arctic and we’ll hear some plain speaking from World Health Organization chief Tedros, on the issue of boosters and vaccine inequity. Not forgetting closing comments from the show’s regular guest, Solange Behoteguy-Cortes. That’s all coming up, in this week’s UN Catch-Up Dateline Geneva.
