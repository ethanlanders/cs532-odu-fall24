Welcome to the OpenCitations homepage!
OpenCitations is an independent not-for-profit infrastructure organization for open scholarship dedicated to the publication of open bibliographic and citation data by the use of Semantic Web ( Linked Data ) technologies. It is also engaged in advocacy for open citations, particularly in its role as a key founding member of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC) . For administrative convenience, OpenCitations is managed by the Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata at the University of Bologna .
OpenCitations espouses fully the founding principles of Open Science. It complies with the FAIR data principles by Force11 that data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable, and it complies with the recommendations of I4OC that citation data in particular should be structured, separable, and open. On the latter topic, OpenCitations has recently published a formal definition of an Open Citation , and has launched a system for globally unique and persistent identifiers (PIDs) for bibliographic citations – Open Citation Identifiers (OCIs) .
OpenCitations' involvement in international networks and collaborations, together with the need of identifying and reaching out to new stakeholders to assure OpenCitations' development and sustainability, has made it necessary to define OpenCitations' mission, unique strengths and next developmental steps, summarized in the following publicly available documents: OpenCitations Mission Statement , The Uniqueness of OpenCitations and OpenCitations – Present Status and Future Plans.
