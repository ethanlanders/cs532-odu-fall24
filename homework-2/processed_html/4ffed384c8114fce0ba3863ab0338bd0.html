DAAD Scholarship Database
The DAAD would like to enable students and graduates from Ukraine to attend higher education institutions in Germany. Therefore, applications for DAAD scholarship programmes for stays in Germany are still regularly possible.
This usually includes scholarships for Master’s programmes, for a doctorate or for research stays in Germany. Unfortunately, they do not include grants for Bachelor’s, Diplom or Staatsexamen degree programmes.
Further information on scholarship programmes for Ukraine can be found in the DAAD scholarship database . Please pay particular attention to the application requirements and deadlines.
If you need advice on DAAD scholarship programmes, please feel free to contact us .
In the DAAD scholarship database you will also find information on scholarship programmes of other organisations. If you have questions about their programmes, please contact the respective organisation  directly.
The DAAD also offers numerous project funding programmes . Applicants for such programmes are German higher education institutions, so the information is only available in German.
