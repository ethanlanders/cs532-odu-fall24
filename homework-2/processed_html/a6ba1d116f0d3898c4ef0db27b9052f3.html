On the 31 January 2022, the Security Council met at the request of the United States over the reported Russian deployment of more than 100,000 troops and war logistics on the Russian-Ukrainian border.
On Monday 21 February, the Council held an emergency meeting, at the request of the delegate of Ukraine over the decision of the Russian Federation to recognise parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent entities. UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo, in her briefing the Council raised concerns over the use of the phrase “peacekeeping mission” by the Russian Federation and also warned of the risks with regionals and global repercussions.
That emergency session was followed by three more on 23rd, 25th and 27th February.  Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in a brief statement during the late-night session on 23rd February strongly urged the Russian President to stop his troops from attacking Ukraine invasion.  But within minutes of this call, and during the meeting, news reports emerged that the Russian Federation had launched a ‘special military operation’ into Ukraine.  Several Council delegates condemned the development.
Late on Friday, 25 February, in response to Russia’s attack, the Council met again to vote on a resolution prepared by the US and Albania, with the support of several other Member States, that would have deplored “Russia’s aggression” and called on Moscow to pull back all its troops.  Eleven members voted in favour of the resolution, and three (China, India, and United Arab Emirates) abstained, but Russia, which was at that time holding the Council’s presidency for the month, vetoed the text.
On Sunday, 27 February, for the fourth time within a week, the Council met in an emergency session and adopted a procedural measure – known informally as ‘ Uniting for peace ’ – calling on the 193-member UN General Assembly to urgently take up a text that would demand an end to the Russian military operation in Ukraine.

As the situation in the region continued to deteriorate following the subsequent launch of Russia’s military offensive, Russia vetoed on 26 February a move in the Security Council to condemn and halt its aggressions against Ukraine. A ‘no’ vote by any of the Council’s permanent members, which along with Russia, include China, France, United Kingdom and the United States, means the measure will not be upheld.
At the end of that meeting in the Council, Ukraine and several other delegates pledged to take a similar resolution to the 193-member General Assembly where it could not be subjected to a veto.
On Sunday, 27 February, the Security Council met in an emergency session and adopted a procedural measure – known informally as ‘ Uniting for peace ’ – calling on the General Assembly to convene an emergency special session to act on a text that would demand an end to the Russian military operation in Ukraine.
Under the Uniting for Peace formula, the Assembly has the power to act “if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility to act as required to maintain international peace and security”.
The Assembly convened its 11th special emergency special session on 1 March and after a day of interventions by the wider UN membership, overwhelmingly adopted a resolution on 2 March demanding that Russia immediately end its military operations in Ukraine.
A total of 141 countries voted in favour of the resolution, which also reaffirmed Ukrainian sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
