High-Level Pledging Event
YPN for UNOCHA
On 1 March 2021, the United Nations and the Governments of Sweden and Switzerland convened a virtual High-Level Pledging Event to contribute to the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan , Country-Based Pooled Fund and the Central Emergency Response Fund for 2021 and beyond.
Despite that millions of Yemenis desperately need more aid to survive, Secretary-General António Guterres described the outcome as “disappointing” as it not only fell short of the $3.85 billion appealed for, but also totalled less than last year’s humanitarian response, and a billion dollars less than the funds raised in 2019.

The United Nations provided support for the negotiations between the Government and the opposition, which resulted in the signing of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism in Riyadh on 23 November 2011. The United Nations has since remained actively engaged with all Yemeni political groupings to facilitate and provide support for the effective implementation of the GCC Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appointed Hans Grundberg of the United Kingdom as his Special Envoy for Yemen in August 2021, replacing Martin Griffiths.
