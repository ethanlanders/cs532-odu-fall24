Recognition of Degrees

Ukraine has been a member of the Bologna Process since 2005. This basis for the comparability of academic achievements facilitates the recognition of academic achievements throughout Europe. However, you must still have it checked whether your previously completed studies entitle you to admission to higher education in Germany.
We hope that the following information will be of additional help to you.
Information for graduates, persons with a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent
Not every Ukrainian degree automatically entitles you to take up further studies in Germany. A Bachelor’s degree obtained abroad sometimes counts only as much as an intermediate examination in Germany and not as a degree.
Before you apply for further studies, you may have to take part in a placement test for the relevant degree programme.
Please contact your target university (usually the International Office ) as soon as possible with your question about admission in order to receive an accurate assessment of your degree.
