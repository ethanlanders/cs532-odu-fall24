Mali
MINUSMA/Harandane Dicko
We do not need to add a crisis to the current crisis. It is necessary that everyone goes to vote [peacefully] and that actors competing in this election accept the ballot box results, and if there is a dispute, that call they on the Malian institutions which are in charge of electoral disputes.
Mahamat Saleh Annadif, head of the UN mission Mali, 27 July '18
Overview
In recent years, Mali has been confronted by a profound crisis with serious political, security, socio-economic, humanitarian and human rights consequences. The crisis stems from long-standing structural conditions such as weak State institutions; ineffective governance; fragile social cohesion; deep-seated feelings among communities in the north of being neglected, marginalized and unfairly treated by the central Government; a weak and externally dependent, albeit vibrant, civil society; and the effects of environmental degradation, climate change and economic shocks. These conditions were exacerbated by more recent factors of instability, including corruption, nepotism, abuse of power, internal strife and deteriorating capacity of the national army.
