Philippines indigenous leader Victoria Tauli-Corpuz is not afraid of a fight.
As a young woman in the 1970s, she joined the movement to protect her mountain homeland from major dam and logging projects.
Her home was raided during martial law a decade later, but she insists it was all “fine.”
But now Ms. Tauli-Corpuz, who is the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, finds herself on the frontline of a new battle.
Earlier this year, the Philippine authorities included her name on a list of people declared as “communist terrorists”.
