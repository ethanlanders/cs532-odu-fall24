Returning Students
Returning students, sometimes referred to as continuing or readmit students, are degree-seeking students who previously attended Old Dominion University and have been gone from the university for at least one year.
All undergraduate degree-seeking students who voluntarily separated from the university while in good academic standing are eligible to apply to be readmitted.
There are a few steps to follow before you can start your summer courses, which can be found here .
Get Ahead with Summer Studies
Enroll in one of nearly 1,500 undergraduate and graduate courses offered on campus and online.
Summer Sessions
ODU's summer schedule offers several sessions with different start and stop dates.
Maymester is three weeks long and occurs during the month of May. Class meeting times are 3-1/2 hour slots.
Session 1 is six weeks long and begins in May.
Session 2 is six weeks long and begins in June.
Session 3 includes 12-week courses and short/condensed courses and begins in May.
You can search for Maymester and Summer courses in our Course Search website or LEO Online . Start and end dates are listed on each course.
The add/drop deadline varies by session, so please refer to the Academic Calendar for specific dates. (Short courses in Session 3 must be dropped before the course start date.)
To drop a class, you must log in to LEO Online and drop the course from your schedule. Courses are not dropped automatically if you fail to appear.
Summer Tuition and Financial Aid
When you register for class, you are responsible for paying tuition and fees for that course.
Failure to drop a course before the drop deadline does not excuse students from financial responsibility for any courses for which they have registered.
In Summer 2024, the tuition deadline is July 8.
