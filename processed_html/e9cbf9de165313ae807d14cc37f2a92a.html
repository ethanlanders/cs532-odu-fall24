Ancient Futures: The 47th Annual ODU Literary Festival
October 6-11, 2024
In a year marked by significant transitions—elections, conflicts abroad, environmental challenges, and more—how can we find our footing? Some authors turn to the past for guidance. They ponder questions, like: What defines us? What events shaped our journey? Where did it all begin? And what possibilities lie ahead? Come join us at the 47th Annual ODU Literary Festival as we honor writers who explore literature's power to anchor us, offering insights into our pasts to inspire visions of our futures.

Remica  Bingham-Risher
Remica Bingham-Risher, a native of Phoenix, Arizona, is a Cave Canem fellow and Affrilachian Poet. Her work has been published in The New York Times, The Writer’s Chronicle, Callaloo and Essence. She is the author of Conversion (Lotus, 2006), winner of the Naomi Long Madgett Poetry Award; What We Ask of Flesh (Etruscan, 2013), shortlisted for the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award; and Starlight & Error (Diode, 2017), winner of the Diode Editions Book Award and finalist for the Library of Virginia Book Award.

Christal Brown
Christal Brown is the Founder of INSPIRIT, Project: BECOMING, the creator of the Liquid Strength training module for dance and an Associate Professor of Dance at Middlebury College. Brown is a native of Kinston, North Carolina, where she remembers cleaning up on Saturday mornings as a child to the music of the Chi-Lites, Marvin Gaye, and Shirley Caesar. These rituals innately produced a strong desire in her to make all work melodic, sensual, meaningful and set to music. Brown has danced since she was released from the confines of piano lessons at age 9 and began navigating her way through narrow corridors of segregated understandings onto the stages of beautiful theaters, community centers, churches, classrooms, and cultural epiphanies. Brown has found the true meaning of grace.  Her path of self- discovery has been influenced by trailblazers such as Chuck Davis, Bill T. Jones, Andrea E. Woods, Liz Lerman, Bebe Miller and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar. Through these conduits of movement matter she was given the opportunity, permission, and responsibility to move and move others. She is a warrior of change and transformation, living out experiences her double amputee father recounted from his war-ridden dreams. The melodies in her body are melancholic and brought to life through the music, seen rather than heard through her choreography. Brown combines her athleticism, creativity, love for people, and passion for teaching to create works that redefine the art of dance and the structure of the field.
Yalie Saweda Kamara
Yalie Saweda Kamara is a Sierra Leonean-American writer, educator, and researcher from Oakland, California. Kamara is the current Cincinnati and Mercantile Library Poet Laureate and a 2023 Academy of American Poets Laureate Fellow.

She is also the author of the chapbooks A Brief Biography of My Name (Akashic Books/African Poetry Book Fund, 2018) and When The Living Sing (Ledge Mule Press, 2017) and editor of the anthology What You Need to Know About Me: Young Writers on Their Experience of Immigration (The Hawkins Project, 2022). Kamara earned a PhD in Creative Writing and English Literature from the University of Cincinnati. She is an assistant professor of English at Xavier University and resides in Cincinnati.
Rebekah Taussig
Rebekah Taussig will challenge everything you think you know about disability as she invites us into her experience of living in a body that looks and moves differently than most. “What would it mean for disabled folks if society saw us as acceptable, equal, valuable parts of the whole?” she writes in her memoir, Sitting Pretty: The View From My Ordinary Resilient Disabled Body (HarperOne).
Taussig, who has been paralyzed since the age of three, is a mom, wife, author, disability advocate and educator with a Ph.D in creative nonfiction and disability studies. Before pivoting to writing, speaking, and consulting, Taussig taught passionately for almost a decade from freshmen in high school to upper-level college classes and continues to offer writing workshops.
She is also one hell of a fighter on a mission to show that disabled people have incredible value; as she argues, a more inclusive world is a sturdier, kinder, more imaginative world for all of us.
A storyteller at heart with a great sense of humor, Taussig invites us to think bigger and more critically about who has a seat at the table and the barriers that bar others from inclusion. She’s held talks and workshops at the University of Michigan, Davidson College and Yale University on disability representation, identity and community, and her writing appears in publications from TIME to Refinery29. She’s been a guest on a myriad of podcasts and also runs the Instagram platform @sitting_pretty, where she crafts “mini-memoirs” for her more than 50,000 followers to contribute nuance to the collective narratives being told about disability in our culture. Taussig is the recipient of the Hefner Heitz Kansas Book Award in Literary Nonfiction for Sitting Pretty.

Devika Rege
Devika Rege is a writer from India. Her debut novel, Quarterlife, is a political bildungsroman set in a time of rising Hindu nationalism. First published in South Asia, it was hailed as "a landmark novel" by The Indian Express. It was also a finalist for five literary awards and won the Mathrubhumi Book of the Year Award and the Ramnath Goenka Sahitya Samman for Best Fiction. It has recently been launched in North America by W.W. Norton, and will be released worldwide in 2025. Devika Rege is a graduate of the universities of Mumbai and Iowa, and lives in Bengaluru.
Manuela Mourão
Manuela Mourão, a mixed media visual artist and professor at ODU, specializes in the literature and culture of the long 19th century. Her art often probes issues explored in her scholarship. Whitewash (focusing on empire and racial identity formation), Remainders (using remaindered copies of her monograph Altered Habits), and Habit (a visual reflection on her academic interests) are examples of how her two practices inform and expand each other. From the Heart, her current project, is at the intersection of personal experience with academic pursuits. In a series of paintings referencing love letters of famous writers contextualized within the trope of Portuguese Love, she offers a visual counterpart to the affirmation of sincere feeling she examines in her latest essay—and which, she argues, has remained part of Portuguese cultural identity for centuries.
Originally from Porto, Portugal, Manuela has lived in the US for three decades. Her artwork has been exhibited internationally at venues like the Vienna Kunsthalle, in Austria, and regionally at various galleries in Virginia, including Target Gallery, Art Space, the Selden Offsite Gallery, the Charles H. Taylor Art Center, Lorrie Saunders Art Gallery, Virginia MOCA, the Sandler Center for the Arts, the Gallery at Pavilion II, the Neil Britton Gallery at Virginia Wesleyan University, the Vestibule at Chrysler Glass Studio, and d’Art Center.
Her art has been featured in book covers, online journals, and is held in several private collections in the US.
Beth  Nguyen
Beth Nguyen is the author of the recent memoir Owner of a Lonely Heart, which was a New York Times Editors’ Choice Pick, as well as the memoir Stealing Buddha’s Dinner, and two novels. She has received an American Book Award and a PEN/Jerard Award and her work has appeared in publications including The New Yorker, The Paris Review, Time, and Best American Essays. She teaches at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where she also directs the MFA Program in Creative Writing.
Wine Dark Sea
Wine Dark Sea is a multi-instrumental folk American duo, featureing two ODU professors, Drew Lopenzina and Liz Black. We mix original compositions with a number of choice cover tunes that take audiences on a rich musical journey filled with guitar, mandolin, flute, harmonica, and concertina. Our songs touch upon current events, heartbreak, love, longing, laughter--inviting audiences to embark with us on our quest for meaningful, great-sounding, epic American music.
