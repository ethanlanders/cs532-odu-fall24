Combines top-class facilities for cutting-edge research with unique learning opportunities for students, doctoral candidates and in particular early-career researchers.
Eligibility criteria
The call is open to all researchers who have completed their doctorate a maximum of three years ago or who will complete their doctorate within the next 12 months. Researchers must reside outside of Germany at the time of submission.
In each call, there are two phases. In Phase I, you do not require an invitation by a TUM host. However, you must identify a TUM host, who will support your application, during Phase II of the submission process. We will assist you in the process and help you find your TUM host in Phase II!
