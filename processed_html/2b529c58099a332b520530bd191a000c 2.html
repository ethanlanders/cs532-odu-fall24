What is MathJax?
MathJax is a javascript display engine for rendering $\TeX$ or
MathML-coded mathematics in browsers without requiring font installation
or browser plug-ins. Any modern browser with javascript enabled will be
MathJax-ready. For general information about MathJax, visit mathjax.org .
Below are questions and answers about the use of MathJax on arXiv.
Where is MathJax being used on arXiv?
We have enabled MathJax on this help page, article abstract and list
pages, the user account page, the submission preview page, search
result pages, and HTML renderings of articles. On these pages, MathJax has been configured to render
inline ($-enclosed) $\TeX$ only. For example, the expression $P(E) = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{ n-k}$ will be rendered as $P(E) = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{ n-k}$. 
On arXiv's articles rendered in HTML, both MathJax and MathML are used, but in all other
places only MathJax is used.
In general, outside of HTML articles MathJax will only attempt to render $\TeX$ in the article title, abstract and comments fields.
How do I know if MathJax is being used on an arXiv page?
MathJax-enabled pages may briefly display a small box to indicate that
the MathJax configuration is being loaded, regardless of whether there
is any renderable $\TeX$ on the page. Valid $\TeX$ expressions will be
displayed by MathJax as the page is being loaded. On abstract pages, any $\TeX$ expressions that MathJax cannot render will be displayed in
their original text.
On the user account and submission preview pages, rendering errors or
unknown macros are displayed in red. For example: $\invalid_TeX$.
Can I see the underlying $\TeX$ coding?
Yes, to access the underlying $\TeX$,
right- or control-click on a rendered math formula, and choose the
format you want from the Format sub-menu.
Then select the Show Source menu item to get a pop-up that allows you to copy the math
source into another application.
To try this feature, visit https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/test/sample-dynamic.html .
Alternatively, MathJax can be disabled entirely (see below).
Can I disable MathJax?
Disable MathJax
When MathJax is disabled, mathematical expressions are displayed as text
with the original $\TeX$ delimiters.
Note that on any particular MathJax-enabled page in arXiv, not all
expressions may be renderable. So turning MathJax on or off may have no
effect on the visual appearance of certain math expressions.
As an arXiv submitter, how can I make the best use of MathJax?
MathJax supports a very large subset of $\TeX$ mathematics, including
AMS math and symbols. arXiv's implementation of MathJax does not support
user-defined macros. For example, if an abstract contains $\rtwo$ as a
shortcut for $\mathbf{R}\^2$, then MathJax will not be able to render
this expression. Submitters should use only standard La$\TeX$ and
AMS-La$\TeX$ macros in paper titles and abstracts.
Also, since '<' is a reserved character in HTML, special care must be
taken in its use. Usually just adding a space after it will suffice for
it not to be interpreted as the start of an element name (e.g., 'x <
y', not 'x<y'); but if in doubt, use the entity reference '<'.
Where can I get help regarding MathJax?
The MathJax web site has useful information about browser configuration,
fonts, MathJax features, etc. Please see the MathJax
documentation and the FAQ if you have
questions.
