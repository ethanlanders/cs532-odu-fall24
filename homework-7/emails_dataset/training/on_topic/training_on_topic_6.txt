Dear ODU Community,
 
This afternoon ODU users were targeted by two separate phishing campaigns. The scam emails were sent with the subject lines: IT HELP and Administrative assistant needed, respectively.
 
These are not legitimate communications. If you received one of these messages:
 
Do not engage with the soliciting party.
Do not supply any personal information (name, address, social, banking/credit card).
If you've already started a conversation, stop any further contact.
If you forwarded the scam email to anyone, please pass this notice along as well.
If you responded to the job scam email, provided personal information, and are concerned about your identity, contact the ODU Police at police@odu.edu.
 
We've seen an increase in phishing attacks and DUO "prompt bombing" lately. To combat these types of attacks, we must all remain aware and vigilant.
