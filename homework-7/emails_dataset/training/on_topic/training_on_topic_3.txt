Dear ODU Community,
 
This morning, ODU users were targeted by a phishing job scam email. The scam emails were sent as fraudulent job opportunity with the subject line: Administrative assistant needed.
 
This is not a legitimate job opportunity. If you received one of these messages:
 
Do not engage with the soliciting party.
Do not supply any personal information (name, address, social, banking/credit card).
If you've already started a conversation, stop any further contact.
If you forwarded the scam email to anyone, please pass this notice along as well.
If you responded to the job scam email, provided personal information, and are concerned about your identity, contact the ODU Police at police@odu.edu.

We've seen an increase in phishing attacks lately, and we highly recommend paying attention to the location of the DUO pushes to avoid any fraudulent users gaining access to your account. To combat these types of attacks, we must all remain aware and vigilant.
