The traditional way to write cursive
In the Consistent Cursive course, you've been learning traditional American cursive letterforms. What you haven't been learning is the traditional way people used their bodies to write cursive. I've stayed away from this topic in Consistent Cursive so you can focus on studying the cursive letterforms, which is critically important. That said, I want to discuss it now so you are aware of the context of what you are learning and what possibilities lie ahead for you.

Movement in Writing
The picture of cursive letters above is based on the same forms you are learning in Consistent Cursive, however, I wrote them using swift arm movements as opposed to the slow, careful finger movements you see in the course videos.
Traditionally, people used arm movement in writing for practical purposes as it provides the ability to write for long periods of time without pain or fatigue. Arm movement also gives a distinct aesthetic to the writing that many find visually appealing. For us modern day writers, writing with arm movement is simply fun - a rewarding act in itself.
If you'd like to learn more using your arm to write traditional American cursive, I invite you to watch my intro series on the Palmer Method.
This 6-part series introduces you to the Palmer Method, which was the most popular system for teaching arm movement writing in America.

I hope you take a look at the Palmer Method Intro Series, but keep focusing on the Consistent Cursive course as everything you learn there you can apply to the Palmer Method later.
Sincerely,
Dave
