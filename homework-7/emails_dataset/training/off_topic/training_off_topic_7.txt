Welcome to Consistent Cursive
It's time to learn cursive!
I'm so glad to have you as a new student. You can access the worksheets for the course in your Gumroad Library. Begin your study by watching the first video of the course here.
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to my email address: info@consistentcursive.com
Sincerely,
Dave
P.S. If you prefer to have a physical workbook for the course, you can purchase one on Amazon.
