Baby came at 5:54am this morning (9th Oct), weighing in at 3.77kg (8 5 in old money). It is bonkers to look at him and think that he fit inside my body. Husband and I are over the moon, but understandably a wee bit shattered as labour started at 9pm Tuesday and progressed very quickly. He is like a gorgeous little alien.

Twin Spica looks like it might be in danger of being axed, so…
:rocket: :dizzy: Reasons to Vote for Twin Spica :rocket: :dizzy:

The five main characters are very distinct from each other in character design and personality. Not all of them get along with each other to the same degree, but their interactions are a lot of fun to watch, and it’s very satisfying to see their bonds strengthen over the course of the story.

Twin Spica dips into several different genres, including: drama, slice-of-life, supernatural (one character is a ghost!), a tiny bit of romance, and some sci-fi elements too. There are a lot of different plot threads that end up interacting with each other in interesting ways.

The story is about a teenage girl pursuing her dream to go to space 13 years after a rocket accident occurred, killing the astronauts on board and many civilians in the city it crashed into. The various affects this continues to have on those involved and the local community is explored very well.

While a good part of the story does take place at a high school, it’s not just any high school, but the Tokyo Space School, so it makes for a unique setting. While I don’t know what actual space schools are like, Yaginuma Kou definitely put in a lot of details into this aspect, which at any rate makes it feel real. There may be no culture festival, but there are plenty of interesting assignments and tests that you won’t be able to read about anywhere else!

Stories featuring teenage protagonists are known for setting parents to the sidelines (or straight up killing them off) to allow for the maximum number of hijinks. This can be interesting at times, but what sets Twin Spica apart is that the fathers of the main characters continuously play an important role in the main characters’ lives. The protagonists’ fathers and the relationships they have with their children are very different, creating an interesting amount of variety and contrast.

The background art is wonderful too, which is great when you have an atypical setting such as a space school, since it really gives you a sense of place. Nature scenes and cityscapes are beautifully depicted as well.

I won’t deny that being frustrating, but I’m on WK’s side on this one because the vowel length difference is very important to Japanese and it’s something learners might want to gloss over as close enough. You want to be treating the distinction as just as important as the difference between any two other sounds.
