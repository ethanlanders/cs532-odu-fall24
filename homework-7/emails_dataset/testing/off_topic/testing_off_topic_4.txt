Hello! I figured I’d add myself to the long lists of study logs in the community so I can also have a place to record my progress and share my struggles/accomplishments! You can call me mag :slight_smile:

Should I take N2 after failing N3?

I know based on the title it’s a no-brainer to think I shouldn’t try for N2 in December but read below to get an idea of where I’m coming from. I could use the advice cause I feel lost with Japanese right now and am not sure what to do.

Need actual reason to learn
Cleverwire

I always wanted to learn japanese and tried several times over the past decade. But I run into the issue over and over again where I have no practical need to actually know japanese. Are there any good books or anything really to help me gain motivation? To gain routine in using? I grew up on japanese animation and I think it’ll be neat to know another language. But honestly, without any actual useage its going to be next to impossible to retain. Any tips to incorporate usage?

So I failed the JLPT again :sweat_smile:
I was so close this time… which actually hurts more since this is like my fifth time taking N1, while I passed N3 and N2 on the first tries :sob:
Though I know it’s all on me and I just need to actually study more.
Hopefully I’ll pass the next time :pray:

Hello everyone. I had promised to participate in the event, but I will have to cancel my participation. I have anxiety problems, and since I don’t know how to write in English well, when I make a post, I get worried, thinking that I wrote something wrong, or that I was misinterpreted. Or that I wrote thinking about one thing, but what is written is something else. Or that I may have been rude in the text. So I spend a lot of time thinking about what I wrote, and if I should change anything.

Finished the first 4 chapters in Vol 6 of Bluelock. The last one was particularily nice to read, maybe only 3/4 look ups across twenty pages. :muscle:
