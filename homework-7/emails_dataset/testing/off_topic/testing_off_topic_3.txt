Sept 2024 - I’d been avoiding the community because I want to focus on doing my reviews than getting lost in the forum, but today felt like a good time to begin my study log.

I’ve had WK for like years now & I’m only at lvl. 12, so I’m adding my name to the ever-growing list of study logs, hoping the pressure will keep me accountable. :saluting_face:

Moin! I’m Arryn! Welcome to my study log.

I want to use this log to track my progress, my routines & tasks and just organize my learning process and maybe talk about various things from my life.
I’ve lurked on a few study logs, but tbh I’m not really deep into the stugy log game, so I’ll need some time to figure it all out! :bowing_woman: (formatting this was a learning experience :upside_down_face: )

✯¸.••✿ ✧･ﾟ: ✧･ﾟ:࣪☾ 2024 goals ☽︎⋆:･ﾟ✧:･ﾟ✧✯✿••.¸✯

Japanese:
Reach Wanikani Lvl. 15
Finish Genki I Chapters 4 & 5
make it through one of the ABBC
Make it at least halfway through Fledgling Forest in MaruMori

Miscellaneous:
Finish my accoustic guitar book
Finish blue routes consitently while bouldering

I’ve never really set studying goals before, so I’m not sure if this is realistic at all for me haha
Especially given that I’m quite slow and there are only three months left of 2024 lmao

Is there an "I dont know" button?
mark8889	
mark8889

Currently, if I dont know the answer to a question, I intentionally type a wrong answer, which may register or not depending on whats being asked, hit enter, then go to the eye icon to see the correct answer. Is there any way I can avoid having to type a wrong answer first? Is there not an “I have no idea, show me the answer” button that I’m somehow missing? If not I feel like there should be. But the eye is greyed out until I going through the process of registering an incorrect answer. Thanks.

Which verb ending to which kanji

is there a way to tell which of the う kana are going to be used to make the base verb of a kanji?

The reason nothing has changed is because there’s nothing to change. 月見 can only be read one way and that’s つきみ. げんみ and がんみ are both wrong. The reason kanji get the shaky screen is because they can be thought of more like letters. There are several different ways to read kanji, but almost all vocab have only one way to say them. There was an example posted here a while ago that I now cannot find, but the gist was:
The letter c can be pronounced “s” or “k”
WK: "How do you pronounce the letter c?
User: “S”
WK: “That is possible, but we’re looking for a different answer.”
User: “K”
WK: “Correct!”
The word cat is pronounced “kat” Saying “sat” is objectively wrong:
WK: “How do you pronounce the word cat?”
User: “Sat”
WK: “No, that’s wrong.”
You don’t get the shaky screen here because there is no instance where sat would ever be an acceptable reading.

Suggestion: Stop marking vocabulary wrong when you give the wrong reading

With ever so slightly a delay :sweat_smile: here is

Have a look at the List of Proposed Books section in the first post for details on each book. Every book has a Natively level associated with it which is annotated in the poll in square brackets after the book’s name (this Natively list contains all nominated books if you want to have a look at the gradings in detail).

Reading:

I had a lot of fun reading ふしぎ駄菓子屋 book 2 this week and discussing each chapter in the offshoot thread on Natively. Making good progress on this, might finish in a couple weeks. Then I’ll be able to start another Goosebumps. I feel like such a fast and powerful reader when I read these 150pg childrens books!
